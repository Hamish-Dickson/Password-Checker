# Password-Checker
A Password checker to check a large file of hacked passwords, for showcase at forth valley college.

Was thrown together in under an hour, so a lot of files and packages retained default names, and there is no javadoc or comments

When running .jar file, please ensure the media folder, as well as the list of passwords, "data.txt" is next to the .jar file.
